        In general, analysis scripts require both the structured array of the

        recommended use is the following::
        
        >>> results = ensemble.perform_experiments(10000) #recommended use
        >>> experiments, output = ensemble.perform_experiments(10000) #will work fine
        
        The latter option will work fine, but most analysis scripts require 
        to wrap it up into a tuple again::
        
        >>> data = (experiments, output)
        
        Another reason for the recommended use is that you can save this tuple
        directly::
