Order Fulfillment Ratio=
	Min(Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate, 1)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \

		orders are lost.

Desired Inventory Coverage=
	 Minimum Order Processing Time + Safety Stock Coverage
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired inventory coverage is the number of weeks of the demand forecast the plant \

	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \

	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \
