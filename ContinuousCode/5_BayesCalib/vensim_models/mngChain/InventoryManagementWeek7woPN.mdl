Prodcution Adjustment from Inventory=
	(Desired Inventory - Inventory)/Inventory Adjustment Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired production rate is adjusted above or below the forecast based on the \

Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage*Expected Order Rate
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired inventory level sought by the plant.  Experience suggests that to \

	|

Desired Inventory Coverage=
	 Minimum Order Processing Time + Safety Stock Coverage
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired inventory coverage is the number of weeks of the demand forecast the plant \
		seeks to maintain
		        in inventory.  This inventory coverage is required to maintain delivery \
		reliability by

		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.

Desired Production = MAX(0,Expected Order Rate+Prodcution Adjustment from Inventory)
	~	Widgets/Week

	~	The order fulfillment rate is equal to the physical shipment rate.
	|

Order Fulfillment Ratio=
	 Table for Order Fulfillment(Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \
		normal shipment rate to the desired rate.  The normal rate is the rate \
		current inventory permits under normal circumstances.  Low inventory \
		availability reduces shipments below customer orders.  Unfilled customer \
		orders are lost.
	|

Production Start Rate=
	Desired Production Start Rate
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The production start rate is the desired production start rate, \
		constrained to be nonnegative.
	|

Safety Stock Coverage=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \
		the firm would like to maintain in inventory over and above the normal \
		order processing time.  The safety stock provides a buffer against the \
		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \
		of orders filled (the order fulfillment ratio.   Shipments fall below \
		desired shipments when the feasible shipment rate falls below the desired \
		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.

	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ability to ship is constrained by inventory availability.  As the inventory \
		level drops, the 
		        fraction of customer orders that can be filled decreases.  When inventory is \
		zero, shipments
		         cease.  Unfilled customer orders are lost.\!\!\!
