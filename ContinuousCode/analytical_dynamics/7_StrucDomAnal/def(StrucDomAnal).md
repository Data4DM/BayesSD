History of SD from a Dominance Perspective is described in [Sato17](https://proceedings.systemdynamics.org/2017/proceed/papers/P1432.pdf)
#ro's software is [here](http://people.tamu.edu/~roliva/research/sd/sda/) with the description:

> This toolset integrates into a single piece of software the utilities and algorithms necessary to perform Structural Development Analysis as described in [Oliva (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278019649_Linking_Structure_to_Behavior_Using_Eigenvalue_Elasticity_Analysis). Specifically, the toolset automates:
i)               the parsing of the Vensim model into the Mathematica notation,
**Loop Eigenvalue Elasticity Analysis (LEEA)**
ii)             the identification of a Shortest Independent Loop Set,
iii)           the linearization and computation of the system eigenvalues at specified points in time,
iv)            the generation of the tables and graphs of loop gains and loop influence on eigenvalues,
**Dynamic Decomposition Weight Analysis (DDWA)**
v)             the equations and graphs that describe the dynamic decomposition weight of state variables, and
vi)            the generation of the tables that report parameter influence on eigenvalues.
