Possimpible is nexus between the Possible and the Impossible (How I met you mother E4.14). Rashomon effect is the situation in which an event is given contradictory interpretations and used to describe the phenomenon of the unreliability of eyewitnesses.

The following figure from [[Stat-Efron computer age stat inf]] illustrates vertical and horizontal conditioning of Bayesian and Frequentist inference in a higher dimension. Due to our cognitive limitation, Bayesian and Frequentists have seeming different approach. However, they are different projections of the same joint data and parameter. Having a point mass prior, Frequentist approach is one of Bayesian approach. Bayesian can also be Frequentist by corresponding Bayesian prior distribution to the frequentist sample space (as Andrew explained [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/06/17/bayesians-are-frequentists/) and Christian added (as comment) how frequentist's loss function correspond to Bayesian's prior and how both aim for decision sets of minimal average size with the only difference being the dimension along which error is controlled).

Understanding both philosophies then allocating it to each participants of data science is possimpible. This is the motivation of the project with as slogan "Cheap Cutting-edge Curation" which is technologically supported by "Prior specifier (Human) and Posterior approximator (Machine) collaboration, controlled by SBC". Specific steps are detailed in [[3 Bayequentist Dynamics with SBC]].


## Reference
- "Frequentist refers to a method approach to evaluating statistical procedure, Bayesian is a method to come up with the procedures. So frequency evaluation would say if I were to apply this procedure many times, how would it perform" from [Data science is NOT Statistics](https://youtu.be/8HG4NM5Ctv8?t=736) 
- "SBC is designed to test Bayesian models and/or algorithms, but it fits very well with standard frequentist ideas (and there is no shame about this" from [Is SBC frequentist]( https://hyunjimoon.github.io/SBC/articles/SBC.html#is-sbc-frequentist) in SBC package vignette
