Domingos [introduces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm) five origins of learning algorithms and by predicted they will be merged to create Master algorithm by 40s. Bayes learning rule Specific instances of the merges I witnessed are:
- Bayesian and Analogizer: updates parameter uncertainty by solving optimization problem [[Bissiri16_BeliefDistUpd.pdf]] 
- Bayesian and Connectionists: Bayes

## What
- There are largely five inference algorithm families
- 
- $$
\begin{array}{lll}
\text { Tribe } & \text { Origins } & \text { Master Algorithm } \\
\text { Symbolists } & \text { Logic, philosophy } & \text { Inverse deduction } \\
\text { Connectionists } & \text { Neuroscience } & \text { Backpropagation } \\
\text { Evolutionaries } & \text { Evolutionary biology } & \text { Genetic programming } \\
\text { Bayesians } & \text { Statistics } & \text { Probabilistic inference } \\
\text { Analogizers } & \text { Psychology } & \text { Kernel machines }
\end{array}
$$
- (weapons): connectionist (neural network), evolutionist (genetic algorithm), Bayesian (Bayes rule), symbolist (decision tree), analogizers (kernel machine)) which are converging: Introduce five tribes of algorithm and its convergence starting from [[Moon17_Domingos15_MasterAlg.pdf]]
