Patterns
From AMD Chp.6, system behavior is classified into six classes:
1. constant
2. growth
3. decline
4. growth then decline
5. decline then growth
6. oscillate

Each of the class has subclass with the total of 25.

However, could we measure the distance between these subclasses? For instance, depeding on the dominant loops at each time, could the following classification be possible? In short, Could patterns have hierarchy? If so, what are branching conditions? Below is my draft with blue letters left for discussions.
