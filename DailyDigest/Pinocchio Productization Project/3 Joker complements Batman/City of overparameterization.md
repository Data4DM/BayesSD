### Joker: degeneracy

definition of degeneracy and identifiability in dynamic models

1.  additive: measurements are informed by only the sum of two parameters 
-   posterior shape: line 
-   suppression strategies: tight prior, scaling strategies, compares the weakly informative prior model to the reparameterization and removal
-   e.g. two compartments and their adjustment time  

2.  multiplication: 
-   posterior shape: xy = c 
-   suppression strategies
-   e.g. market size * market share  

3.  discrete allocation: exchangeable mixture model
-   posterior shape: multimodal  
    Multimodality as a heterogenous combination of homogenous units VS a homogenous combination of heterogeneous units 
-   suppression strategies: embed prior known order, [convexification](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/116)
-   e.g. allocation, leader and follower’s market share
