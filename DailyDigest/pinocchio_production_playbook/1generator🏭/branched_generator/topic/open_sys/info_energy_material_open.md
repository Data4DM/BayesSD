## What 

System where only the information type of inflow is allowed

## How

-   Expressed as time-sharing hierarchical model which extends from original population dynamics

## Why

-   e.g. different countries or states for covid epidemic model
-   Minimax formulation in Wasserstein distance (which reminds me of w-GAN) are detailed in [Robust Wasserstein Profile Inference and Applications to Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05627.pdf) which says “view regularization as a result of introducing an artificial adversary that perturbs the empirical distribution to account for out-of-sample effects in loss estimation.”
