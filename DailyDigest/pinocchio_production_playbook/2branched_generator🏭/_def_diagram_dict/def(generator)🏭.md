goal: trace branched history in [structre (SD, Stats) X obejctive function X optimization algorithm]
- factors contributing to branched posterior (generator, estimator, discriminator)

- #tfq generator vs simulator?
- compositonal [[def(Generator)]] and [[👁🧠🌲🏭 Digital Twin/deConv(Digital Twin)/👓 Discriminator/def(Discriminator)]]
- procedural def: follows 👁🧠🌲🏭 
## 👁🧠
- abstract measured (perceived) to science
## 🧠🌲
- hierarchize sceince to desgine blueprint
## 🌲🏭 

- produce with hierarchized blueprint
