## three measures
- effectiveness := recovery quality (`lp__` plot, group truth within 90% interval)
- efficency := optimization time
- sastisfaction := understandable interpretation especially on heterogenity and 


## efficiency and effectiveness
- proportional quality and speed; should fire fu (but rare)
- adding group to hierarchy moves fp to sp
- 
| speed, quality | pretty | ugly |
| -------------- | ------ | ---- |
| fast           | fp     | _fu_ |
| slow           | sp     | su   |


## process noise and effectiveness
