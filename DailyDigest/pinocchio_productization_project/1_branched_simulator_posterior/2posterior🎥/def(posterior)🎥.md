- our quantity of interest in our hand; combined effects of [[def(simulator)üè≠]] and inference algorithms such as below which Domingos [introduces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm) as five origins of learning algorithms 

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\text { Tribe } & \text { Origins } & \text { Master Algorithm } \\
\text { Symbolists } & \text { Logic, philosophy } & \text { Inverse deduction } \\
\text { Connectionists } & \text { Neuroscience } & \text { Backpropagation } \\
\text { Evolutionaries } & \text { Evolutionary biology } & \text { Genetic programming } \\
\text { Bayesians } & \text { Statistics } & \text { Probabilistic inference } \\
\text { Analogizers } & \text { Psychology } & \text { Kernel machines }
\end{array}
$$

- (weapons): connectionist (neural network), evolutionist (genetic algorithm), Bayesian (Bayes rule), symbolist (decision tree), analogizers (kernel machine)) which are converging.
