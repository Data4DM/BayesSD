Building on [[branched_optimization_algorithms]], Domingos predicted they will be merged to create Master algorithm by 40s. Bayes learning rule Specific instances of the merges I witnessed are:
- Bayesian and Analogizer: updates parameter uncertainty by solving optimization problem [[Bissiri16_BeliefDistUpd.pdf]] 
- Bayesian and Connectionists: Bayes deep learning
