## What

Verification, Estimation on bounded range with ϵ- optimality/feasibility (based on weak optimization = weak separation)

Among inductive bias, this address [#statistical_error](https://publish.obsidian.md/#statistical_error), related to the hypothesis function expressed with given number of samples.

-   what: computationally efficient reliability verification of hierarchical model inference
    
-   how: operator-based probabilistic programming language PPL [[Computer-PPL History and Trend]]
    
-   why: simulation is a weak solution of equations which generated reality and "what" above is needed to verify the closeness of simulation and reality. With "online" flavor added to simulation for digital twins as [this](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin) IBM report shows, computational efficiency is the key for CAT. By weak solution, I mean just as SDE's weak solution is constructed on a new setting (probability space, sigma algebra, measure, and filtration) and weakly equal to the strong solution, twin is a newly constructed object that is weakly equal to reality. With this view, CAT's main job in catching RAT (:= generative regression modeling languages) becomes searching for counterexamples i.e. a member of determining class ϕ breaching the (in)equality. Digitizing this falsifying logic is its aim. An example is finding an counterexample for inequality using a increasing function δ1∈ϕ (determining class for ≥st, and n = 2. 1n∑l=1nXi≥st1n+1∑i=1n+1Xi (further check needed!)
    

Consistency Ability Test, Consistency Analyzing Test, Calibrate and Test are current candidates for the name CAT. Filtering models that are [Accurate, yet inconsistent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06665.pdf) is CAT's goal based on their potential danger.
