##### Joker: 
- funnel: this is different from degeneracy as this is optimization algorithm-specific unlike degeneracy. Gibbs sampler and HMC for centered parameterized hierarchical model from funnel whereas non-centered parameterization doesn’t.
- near zero scale parameter:
    

##### Batman: order

- sbc i.e. increasting `S` to allow trolls to present themselves
- trace plots
- divergence on posterior pairplot
