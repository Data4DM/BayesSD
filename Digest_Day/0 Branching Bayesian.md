Branching from one to many based on the homogenity assumption i.e. from tight to diffuse prior. 

## 46656 Varieties of Bayesians 
Good83 classified Bayesians into 46656 varieties with as: 

46656 = 
- 2 (type two rationality) X 2 (kinds of judgements) X 3 (judgement precision) X 3 (extremeness) 
- X 3 (utilities) X 3(quasiutilities)
- X 3 (physical probabilities) X 4 (conditions)
- X 2 (device of imaginary result) X 3 (axioms) X 2 (probabilities) 
 
 Each person has different demand but 46656 number of classification would suffice to give template for suppliers i.e. modelers who translate demand into a program, compute draws, and collect data.
 
Fun fact: Invention of 0 allowed infinity representation. So 0 is $\infty$.
