## 46656 Varieties of Bayesians
Good83 classified Bayesians into 46656 varieties with as: 

46656 = 
- 2 (type two rationality) * 2 (kinds of judgements) * 3 (judgement precision) * 3 (extremeness) 
- * 3 (utilities) * 3(quasiutilities)
- * 3 (physical probabilities) * 4 (conditions)
- * 2 (device of imaginary result) 3 (axioms) * 2 (probabilities) 
 
 Each person has different demand but 46656 number of classification would suffice to give template for suppliers i.e. modelers who translate demand into a program, compute draws, and collect data.
