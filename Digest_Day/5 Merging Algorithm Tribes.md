ML algorithms branched out from largely five sources. They are merging accoring to Master Algorithm summarized in [[Moon17_Domingos15_MasterAlg.pdf]] 

## What
- Understand hierarchy of algorithm and how they are converging: Introduce five tribes of algorithm and its convergence starting from this slide: 
- Understand Bayesian inference as updating parameter uncertainty by solving optimization problem [[Bissiri16_BeliefDistUpd.pdf]]
