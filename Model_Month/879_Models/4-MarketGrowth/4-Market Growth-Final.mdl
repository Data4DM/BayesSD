		Market Growth Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the version of Forrester's (1968) Market Growth Model
		developed in chapter 15.  The company goal for delivery delay is
		fixed, and market potential is unlimited.
		
		The model includes switches to decouple the sectors and allow 
		partial model testing.
	|

Backlog= INTEG (
	Order Rate-Shipment Rate,
		Initial Backlog)
	~	Units
	~	The backlog of unfilled orders.
	|

Book to Bill Ratio=
	Order Rate/Shipment Rate
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The book to bill ratio is a common measure of the health of high-tech \
		companies.
	|

Pressure to Expand Capacity=
	Switch for Endogenous Pressure*(Delivery Delay Perceived by Company/Company Goal for Delivery Delay\
		) + (1-Switch for Endogenous Pressure)*Exogenous Pressure for Expansion
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Pressure to expand capacity arises when the perceived delivery delay is \
		greater than the firm's goal for delivery delay.  The Switch for \
		Endogenous Pressure allows expansion pressure to be made exogenous for \
		testing purposes.
	|

Exogenous Delivery Delay=
	Normal Delivery Delay*(1+STEP(0.5, 6) + STEP(-0.5, 18) + STEP(-0.5,60) + STEP(0.5,72\
		))
	~	Months
	~	Exogenous delivery delay for model testing purposes.  Inclues a variety of \
		step inputs.
	|

Exogenous Order Rate=
	600
	~	Units/Month
	~	Exogenous order rate for model testring.
	|

Exogenous Pressure for Expansion=
	Normal Expansion Pressure*(1+STEP(0.25, 6) + STEP(-0.25, 30) + STEP(-0.25,60) + STEP\
		(0.25,84))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Exogenous pressure for expansion is based on the normal value and adjusted \
		by avariety of step functions for testing purposes.
	|

Exogenous Sales Effectiveness=
	Normal Sales Effectiveness*(1+ STEP(-0.75, 60))
	~	Units/(Month*Person)
	~	Exogenous sales effectiveness for model testing.  Includes a step input.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = Sales Effectiveness determined by delivery delay.
		0 = Sales Effectiveness is exogenous for testing purposes.
	|

Delivery Delay=
	Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay*(Backlog/Shipment Rate) +  (1-Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay\
		)*Exogenous Delivery Delay
	~	Month
	~	Delivery delay is the rato of backlog to shipments.  For model testing \
		purposes, delivery delay can be set to an exogenous value.
	|

Initial Capacity=
	500
	~	Units/Month
	~	Initial capacity is 500 units/month.
	|

Switch for Capacity Constraint=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = shipments determined by capacity and capacity utilization.  0 = \
		shipments always equal desired production, which keeps the delivery delay \
		constant at the normal value.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = delivery delay determined by backlog and shipments.   0 = delivery \
		delay determined exogenously.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Switch for Capacity Constraint*Capacity*Capacity Utilization+(1-Switch for Capacity Constraint\
		)*Desired Production
	~	Units/Month
	~	Shipments can be constrained by capacity or set equal to the desired rate.  \
		Setting the Switch for Capacity Constraint to 1 means shipments are \
		determined by capacity and capacity utilization.  When the switch is zero, \
		shipments always equal the rate that keeps the delivery delay constant at \
		the normal value.
	|

Sales Effectiveness=
	Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness*(Normal Sales Effectiveness*Effect of Delivery Delay on Sales Effectiveness\
		) + (1-Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness)*Exogenous Sales Effectiveness
	~	Units/Month/Person
	~	Sales effectiveness is determined by the delivery delay for the product \
		(when theSwitch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness = 1).  Otherwise it is \
		exogenous for model testing.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Pressure=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = Expansion pressure determined by perceived delivery delay and the \
		delivery delay goal.  0 = exogenous expansion pressure.
	|

Initial Backlog=
	1
	~	Units
	~	The initial backlog is one unit.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Orders=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = orders determined by sales force and sales effectiveness.  0 = orders \
		are exogenous.
	|

Order Rate=
	Switch for Endogenous Orders*Sales Force*Sales Effectiveness+(1-Switch for Endogenous Orders\
		)*Exogenous Order Rate
	~	Units/Month
	~	Orders are determined by the sales force and sales force effetiveness when \
		the Switch for Endogenous Orders = 1.  Setting the switch to 0 cuts the \
		sales growth feedback for partial model testing purposes.
	|

Normal Expansion Pressure=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Normal expansion pressure is one, indicating that current capacity is \
		adequate.
	|

Capacity=
	SMOOTH3I(Desired Capacity,Capacity Acquisition Delay,Initial Capacity)
	~	Units/Month
	~	Production capacity adjusts to target capacity with an average lage given \
		by the capacity acquisition time.  A third-order delay is assumed.  \
		Expansion and contraction are symmetric, for simplicity.
	|

		decreases.

	~	The fully loaded cost per sales representative is $8000/month.
	|

Delivery Delay Perceived by Company=
	SMOOTH(Delivery Delay,Time for Company to Perceive Delivery Delay)
	~	Month
	~	The delivery delay recognized by the company lags behind true \
		availability.  First order smoothing is assumed.
	|

Delivery Delay Perceived by Market=
	SMOOTH(Delivery Delay Perceived by Company,Time for Market to Perceive Delivery Delay\
		)
	~	Months
	~	The delivery delay perceived by the market lags behind the quotes given by \
		the company, which in turn lag the true availability of the product.  \
		First-order smoothing is assumed.
	|

Desired Capacity=
	Capacity*Effect of Expansion Pressure on Desired Capacity
	~	Units/Month
	~	Desired capacity is anchored on current capacity, then adjusted up or down \
		based on the pressure for expansion the firm recognizes.
	|

	Table for Effect of Delivery Delay on Sales Effectiveness(Delivery Delay Perceived by Market\
		/Market Target Delivery Delay)
	~	Dimensionless

		from other suppliers.
