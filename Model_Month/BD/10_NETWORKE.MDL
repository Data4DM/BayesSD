		Simple Network Externality Model

		This model captures the competition for market share of two firms in an environment
		where product attractiveness depends on the installed base of the product, \
		representing
		network externality and compatibility effects.  In this version, the \
		product is not discarded.  Chapter 10.
	|

Installed Base Product 2= INTEG (
	Sales of Product 2,
		Initial Installed Base Product 2)
	~	Units
	~	The installed base of product 2 is the accumulation of  sales.   There are \
		no discards.
	|

Total Demand=
	1e+006
	~	Units/Year
	~	The demand for products in this simple model is constant at 1 million \
		units/year
	|

Installed Base Product 1= INTEG (
	Sales of Product 1,
		Initial Installed Base Product 1)
	~	Units
	~	The installed base of product 1 is the accumulation of  sales.   There are \
		no discards.
	|

Product 2 Share of Installed Base=
	Installed Base Product 2/Total Installed Base
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of the installed base of products that are product 2.
	|

Total Installed Base=
	Installed Base Product 1 + Installed Base Product 2
	~	Units
	~	The total number of products that are currently in use.
	|

Product 1 Share of Installed Base=
	Installed Base Product 1/Total Installed Base
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of the installed base of products that are product 1.
	|

Effect of Other Factors on Attractiveness of Product 2=
	RANDOM NORMAL(0,4,1,Standard Deviation of Random Effects on Attractiveness,Noise Seed for Random Effects on Attractiveness of Product 2
	)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The aggregate effect of factors on the attractiveness of product 2, \
		excluding compatibility. This formulation aggregates the effects of price, \
		features, availability, and so on into a single factor, which in this \
		simple model is assumed to be exogenous.
	|

Initial Installed Base Product 1=
	1
	~	Units
	~	The initial number of product in use.
	|

Noise Seed for Random Effects on Attractiveness of Product 1=
	2000
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The initial input to the random function for determining the effects of \
		attractiveness from outside factors of product 1.
	|

Initial Installed Base Product 2=
	1
	~	Units
	~	The initial number of product 2 in use.
	|

Noise Seed for Random Effects on Attractiveness of Product 2=
	1000
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The initial input to the random function for determining the effects of \
		attractiveness from outside factors of product 2.
	|

Effect of Compatibility on Attractiveness of Product 1=
	EXP(Sensitivity of Attractiveness to Installed Base * Installed Base Product 1/Threshold for Compatibility Effects\
		)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The effect of compatibility on attractiveness captures the network and \
		compatibility effects:  the larger the installed base, the greater the \
		attractiveness of that product. There are a number of plausible shapes for \
		the relationship between installed base and attractiveness.
	|

Effect of Compatibility on Attractiveness of Product 2=
	EXP(Sensitivity of Attractiveness to Installed Base * Installed Base Product 2/Threshold for Compatibility Effects\
		)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The effect of compatibility on attractiveness  captures the network and \
		compatibility effects:  the larger the installed base, the greater the \
		attractiveness of that product. There are a number of plausible shapes for \
		the relationship between installed base and attractiveness.
	|

Sensitivity of Attractiveness to Installed Base=
	2
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The parameter allows the modeler to vary the strength of the effect of \
		compatiblity on product attractiveness in sensitivity tests.
	|

Standard Deviation of Random Effects on Attractiveness=
	STEP(0.01,0)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	A 1% standard deviation for the randome effects on attractiveness is \
		assumed.
	|

Threshold for Compatibility Effects=
	1e+006
	~	Units
	~	The threshold is a scaling factor representing the size of the installed \
		base above which network effects become important.
	|

Attractiveness of Product 1=
	Effect of Compatibility on Attractiveness of Product 1*Effect of Other Factors on Attractiveness of Product 1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Attractiveness is the product of two terms:  the effect of compatibility \
		on attractiveness (the network effect) and the effect of all other factors \
		of attractiveness.
	|

Attractiveness of Product 2=
	Effect of Compatibility on Attractiveness of Product 2 * Effect of Other Factors on Attractiveness of Product 2
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Attractiveness is the product of two terms:  the effect of compatibility \
		on attractiveness (the network effect) and the effect of all other factors \
		of attractiveness.
	|

Effect of Other Factors on Attractiveness of Product 1=
	RANDOM NORMAL(0,4,1,Standard Deviation of Random Effects on Attractiveness,Noise Seed for Random Effects on Attractiveness of Product 1\
		)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The aggregate effect of factors on the attractiveness of product 2, \
		excluding compatibility. This formulation aggregates the effects of price, \
		features, availability,  and so on into a single factor, which in this \
		simple model is assumed to be exogenous.
	|

Market Share Product 1=
	Attractiveness of Product 1/Total Attractiveness of All Products
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Market share is determined by the attractiveness of each firm's products \
		relative to the  attractiveness of the other firms' products.
	|

Market Share Product 2=
	Attractiveness of Product 2/Total Attractiveness of All Products
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Market share is determined by the attractiveness of each firm's products \
		relative to the  attractiveness of the other firms' products.
	|

Sales of Product 1=
	Total Demand * Market Share Product 1
	~	Units/Year
	~	The sales rate is determined by the market share for the given product and \
		the exogenous total demand.
	|

Sales of Product 2=
	Total Demand * Market Share Product 2
	~	Units/Year
	~	The sales rate is determined by the market share for the given product and \
		the exogenous total demand.
	|

Total Attractiveness of All Products=
	Attractiveness of Product 1 + Attractiveness of Product 2
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Total attractiveness is the sum of the attractiveness levels of all \
		products in the marketplace.
