		Adaptive Expectations Model with Random Walk

		This is the generic structure for adaptive expectations (first-order exponential
		smoothing).  The test input here is a random walk.  Chapter 11
	|

Adjustment Time=
	7
	~	Day
	~	The time constant or delay time for the adjustment of the perceived input \
		to the reported value.
	|

Change in Perceived Value=
	"Error (Reported Value - Perceived Value)"/Adjustment Time
	~	Units/Day
	~	The perceived state of the system adjusts in proportion to the error, or \
		gap between the actual and perceived value of the input.
	|

"Error (Reported Value - Perceived Value)"=
	"Input: Reported Value of Variable (X)"-"Output: Perceived Value of Input"
	~	Units
	~	The error is the gap between the reported and perceived value of the input.
	|

Input to Random Walk=
	RANDOM NORMAL(-100,100,0,50,1.23144e+007)
	~	Units/Day
	~	The rate of change in the random walk variable is a normally distributed \
		random variable with mean 0  and standar d deviation of 50 units/day.
	|

"Input: Reported Value of Variable (X)"=
	Random Walk
	~	Units
	~	The input to the adaptive expectations structure is a random walk (for \
		testing purposes).
	|

"Output: Perceived Value of Input"= INTEG (
	Change in Perceived Value,
		"Input: Reported Value of Variable (X)")
	~	Units
	~	The output of adaptive expectations is a stock representing the perceived \
		state of the system.
	|

Random Walk= INTEG (
	Input to Random Walk,
		1000)
	~	Units
	~	A random walk with normally distributed changes.  Used as a test input.
