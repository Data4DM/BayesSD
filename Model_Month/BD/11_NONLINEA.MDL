		First-order adaptive expectations with nonlinear time constant.
		Adapted here to model the memory of layoffs by workers in a firm.
		Workers adapt to new layoffs very fast, but remember layoffs a long time.
		Chapter 11.

Change in Layoff Memory=
	(Layoff Fraction -  Memory of Layoffs)/Memory Adjustment Time
	~	(1/Week)/Week
	~	The memory of layoffs adjusts by first-order exponential smoothing to the \
		actual fractional layoff rate.
	|

Layoff Fraction=
	STEP(0.1,0)-STEP(0.1,4)
	~	1/Week
	~	The actual fractional rate of layoffs, exogenous for testing purposes here.
	|

Memory Adjustment Time=
	IF THEN ELSE(Layoff Fraction>=Memory of Layoffs,Time to Increase,Time to Decrease)
	~	Week
	~	The memory adjustment time is one value when the actual layoff fraction \
		exceeds the memory and a different (longer, in this case) value when the \
		actual layoff fraction is less than the memory.  Thus workers adapt to \
		layoffs very fast but remember them a long time.
	|

Memory of Layoffs= INTEG (
	Change in Layoff Memory,
		0)
	~	1/Week
	~	The memory of layoffs.  Initially 0 (no layoffs in memory)
	|

Time to Decrease=
	25
	~	Week
	~	Workers remember layoffs a long time - and average of 25 weeks in this \
		test case.
	|

Time to Increase=
	1
	~	Week
	~	Workers adapt to new layoffs very fast - in one week.
