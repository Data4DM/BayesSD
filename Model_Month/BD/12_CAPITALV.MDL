		Capital Vintaging Model

		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model, developed in chapter 12, combines an aging chain with coflows.
		It tracks the input (factor) requirements of a firm's capital stock (such as 
		labor, energy, or materials requirements, or emissions generated per unit of capital \
		per period)
		from the ordering of new plant and equipment through ultimate discard.  Three
		vintages of capital are assumed.
	|
