		A generic model of floating goals in which the desired state of the system
		adjusts to actual performanc (chapter 13).
	|

Desired State of System= INTEG (
	Net Change in Desired State,
		Initial Desired State of System)
	~	Units
	~	The desired state of the system is initialized to an exogenous initial \
		value.
	|

Goal Adjustment Time=
	1e+009
	~	Weeks
	~	The time required for the goal to adjust to actual performance.
	|

Initial Desired State of System=
	100
	~	Units
	~	The initial goal for the state of the system.
	|

Initial State of System=
	100
	~	Units
	~	The initial state of the system.
	|

Net Change in Desired State=
	(State of the system - Desired State of System)/Goal Adjustment Time
	~	Units/Week
	~	The goal adjusts to the actual state of the system over the Goal \
		Adjustment Time.
	|

Net Change in State=
	(Desired State of System - State of the system)/State Adjustment Time
	~	Units/Week
	~	The state of the system adjusts to the desired state over the State \
		Adjustment Time.
	|

State Adjustment Time=
	8
	~	Weeks
	~	The time required to adjust the state of the system to the goal.
	|

State of the system= INTEG (
	Net Change in State,
		Initial State of System)
	~	Units
	~	The state of the system is initialized to an exogenous level for testing \
		purposes.
