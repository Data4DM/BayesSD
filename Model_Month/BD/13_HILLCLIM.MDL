	~	In general, there can be multiple external pressures causing the desired state

		assumed, and it is set equal to the exponential function of the external pressures,.
		with a sensitivity parameter to control the strength of the effect.  In general, 
		these effects can be arbitrary nonlinear functions of the pressures.
