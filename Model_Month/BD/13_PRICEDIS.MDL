		Price Discovery Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is a simple model of price discovery in a competitive market (chapter 13).
		The process of price discoveryis modeled as a hill-climbing search
		using the demand/supply balance as a measure of the gradient.
		
		In this simple test model, there are no delays in the response of demand
		or supply to price.

Change in Price=
	(Indicated Price - Price)/Price Adjustment Time
	~	$/unit/Period
	~	Price adjusts to the indicated level over the Price Adjustment Time.
	|

Change in Reference Demand=
	0.2
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fractional change in reference demand
	|

Demand=
	Reference Demand*(Price/Reference Price)^Demand Elasticity
	~	Units/Period
	~	Demand is given by a constant elasticity demand curve.  Demand equals the \
		reference level at the reference price.
	|

Demand Curve Shift Time=
	0
	~	Period
	~	The time at which the demand curve shifts
	|

Demand Elasticity=
	-0.25
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The elasticity of demand (the fractional change in demand for a given \
		fractional change in price)
	|

"Demand/Supply Balance"=
	Demand/Supply
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The balance between demand and supply, expressed as a dimensionless ratio.
	|

"Effect of Demand/Supply Balance on Price"=
	"Demand/Supply Balance"^"Sensitivity of Price to Demand/Supply Balance"
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The effect of the demand/supply balance on price is a power function of \
		the demand/supply balance.  The higher the sensitivity of price to the \
		demand/supply balance, the greater the change in price induced by any \
		imbalance.
	|

Indicated Price=
	Price*"Effect of Demand/Supply Balance on Price"
	~	$/unit
	~	Market makers raise the indicated price above the current level when \
		demand exceeds supply, and lower it when supply exceeds demand.
	|

Initial Reference Demand=
	100
	~	Units/Period
	~	The initial reference demand is 100 units/period
	|

Price= INTEG (
	Change in Price,
		100)
	~	$/unit
	~	The price of the product.  Initially equal to $100/unit.
	|

Price Adjustment Time=
	1
	~	Period
	~	Price adjusts to the indicated level over this interval.
	|

Reference Demand=
	Initial Reference Demand*(1+STEP(Change in Reference Demand, Demand Curve Shift Time\
		))
	~	Units/Period
	~	Reference Demand is the demand generated at the reference price.
	|

Reference Price=
	100
	~	$/unit
	~	The reference price is $100/unit.
	|

Reference Supply=
	100
	~	Units/Period
	~	Reference supply is 100 units/period.
	|

"Sensitivity of Price to Demand/Supply Balance"=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Determines the response of the indicated price to imbalances between \
		demand and supply.
	|

Supply=
	Reference Supply * (Price/Reference Price)^Supply Elasticity
	~	Units/Period
	~	Supply is given by a constant elasticity supply curve.  Supply equals the \
		reference supply at the reference price.
	|

Supply Elasticity=
	0.5
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The elasticity of supply (the fractional change in supply for a given \
		fractional change in price)
