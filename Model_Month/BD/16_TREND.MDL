		TREND Function

		This model implements the TREND function described in chapter 16.
		
		The TREND function provides a behavioral model for the estimation of
		a trend from the past behavior of an input.  The function takes any 
		variable as an input and returns as estimate of its fractional (continuous
		compouding) rate of change.
	|

Change in PPC=
	(INPUT - "Perceived Present Condition (PPC)")/"Time to Perceive Present Condition (TPPC)"
	~	Units/time unit
	~	The perceived present condition adjusts to the actual value of the input \
		via first-order smoothing, with a time constant given by TPPC.
	|

Change in RC=
	("Perceived Present Condition (PPC)" - "Reference Condition (RC)")/"Time Horizon for Reference Condition (THRC)"
	~	Units/time unit
	~	The reference condition adjusts via first-order smoothing to the perceived \
		present condition, with a time constant given by THRC, representing the \
		historical horizon for trend calculation.  The longer THRC, the farther \
		back in history the decision makers consider when estimating growth rates.
	|

Change in TREND=
	("Indicated Trend (ITREND)" - "Perceived Trend (TREND)")/"Time to Perceive Trend (TPT)"
	~	1/(time unit*time unit)
	~	The perceived trend adjusts via first-order smoothing to the indicated \
		value, with a time constant given by TPT.
	|

Growth Rate=
	0.05
	~	1/time unit
	~	The exponential growth rate for the test input.
	|

"Indicated Trend (ITREND)"=
	("Perceived Present Condition (PPC)" -"Reference Condition (RC)")/("Reference Condition (RC)"\
		*"Time Horizon for Reference Condition (THRC)")
	~	1/time unit
	~	The indicated TREND is the growth rate of the input indicated now based on \
		the reference condition and the perceived present condition.  It may take \
		time for decision makers to recognize and respond to this value.  The \
		indicated trend yields an unbiased estimate, in steady state, of the \
		fractional growth rate in the input.
	|

Initial Input=
	100
	~	Units
	~	Initial value of the test input.
	|

INPUT=
	Initial Input*EXP(Growth Rate*Time)
	~	Units
	~	The input to the TREND function.  Set for testing purposes to an \
		exponential.
	|

OUTPUT=
	"Perceived Trend (TREND)"
	~	1/time unit
	~	The output of the TREND function is simply the perceived trend.
	|

"Perceived Present Condition (PPC)"= INTEG (
	Change in PPC,
		INPUT/(1+"Perceived Trend (TREND)"*"Time to Perceive Present Condition (TPPC)"))
	~	Units
	~	The perceived present condition of the input lags behind the true input to \
		capture data reporting and perception delays.  Set initially in the steady \
		state given the user-supplied initial value of the perceived trend.
	|

"Perceived Trend (TREND)"= INTEG (
	Change in TREND,
		0)
	~	1/time unit
	~	The Perceived TREND is the decision makers' belief about the current \
		fractional rate of change in the input.
	|

"Reference Condition (RC)"= INTEG (
	Change in RC,
		"Perceived Present Condition (PPC)"/(1+"Perceived Trend (TREND)"*"Time Horizon for Reference Condition (THRC)"\
		))
	~	Units
	~	The reference condition is an exponentially weighted average of the past \
		values of the perceived present condition.  It represents the value of the \
		input THRC periods in the past.  Set initially in the steady state given \
		the user-supplied initial value of the perceived trend.
	|

"Time Horizon for Reference Condition (THRC)"=
	1
	~	time unit
	~	The long the time horizon, the more short-term variation in the growth \
		rate of the input will be filtered out by the TREND function.
	|

"Time to Perceive Present Condition (TPPC)"=
	0.25
	~	time unit
	~	The average  lag in the reporting and perception of the input.
	|

"Time to Perceive Trend (TPT)"=
	0.25
	~	time unit
	~	The time required for decision makers to adjust their beliefs and reports \
		to the indicated trend.  Represents report preparation and perception \
		delays in the adjustment of growth expectations to new information.
