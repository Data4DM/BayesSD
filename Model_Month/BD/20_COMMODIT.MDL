		This is the generic price-mediated commodity market model developed in
		chapter 20.  Includes capacity and investment, utilization of existing
		capacity, price, and demand.  Parameters of the base case correspond
		roughly to the paper industry.

Expected Production Costs=
	SMOOTH(Unit Costs,Time to Adjust Expected Costs)
	~	$/Unit
	~	Expected Production Costs represent beliefs among market participants \
		about the unit costs of production (variable and fixed, including normal \
		profit margins).  Expected Costs therefore represent beliefs about what a \
		'fair' price would be, or the long-run equilibrium price.  Expected costs \
		adjust to the actual costs with a delay representing the time required for \
		gain information and adjust beliefs about costs.

	~	Dimensionless
	~	Utilization is a nonlinear function of the expected markup ratio.  For \
		high markups, producers seek to operate at maximum utilization.  As the \
		markup ratio falls, expensive measures to boost short-run output are \
		discontinued, and eventually,  high-cost producers are forced to drop out \
		of the market.  The function represents the short-run supply curve for the \
		industry.  Because there is a distribution of costs, the aggregate curve \
		for the industry as a whole is smooth, and some producers continue to \
		operate even when the markup ratio is less than one.
