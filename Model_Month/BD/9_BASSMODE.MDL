		The Bass Innovation Diffusion Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the classic Bass innovation diffusion model, with
		advertising and word of mouth as drivers of adoption.
		Chapter 9.
	|

Adoption Rate AR=
	Adoption from Advertising + Adoption from Word of Mouth
	~	Units/Year
	~	The rate at which a potential adopter becomes an active adopter. This is \
		driven by advertising efforts and the word of mouth effect.
	|

Advertising Effectiveness a=
	0.011
	~	1/Year
	~	Advertising results in adoption according the effectiveness of the \
		advertising.
	|

Adoption from Advertising=
	Advertising Effectiveness a*Potential Adopters P
	~	Units/Year
	~	Adoption can result from advertising according to the effectiveness of the \
		advertising effort with the pool of potential adopters.
	|

Total Population N=
	1e+006
	~	Units
	~	The size of the total population.
	|

Adoption from Word of Mouth=
	Contact Rate c*Adoption Fraction i*Potential Adopters P*Adopters A/Total Population N
	~	Units/Year
	~	Adoption by word of mouth is driven by the contact rate between potential \
		adopters and active adopters and the fraction of times these interactions \
		will result in adoption. The word of mouth effect is small if the number \
		of active adopters relative to the total population size is small.
	|

Contact Rate c=
	100
	~	1/Year
	~	The rate at which active adopters come into contact with potential \
		adopters.
	|

Adopters A= INTEG (
	Adoption Rate AR,
		0)
	~	Units
	~	The number of active adopters in the system.
	|

Adoption Fraction i=
	0.015
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of times a contact between an active adopter and a potential \
		adopter results in adoption.
	|

Potential Adopters P= INTEG (
	-Adoption Rate AR,
		Total Population N - Adopters A)
	~	Units
	~	The number of potential adopters is determined by the total population \
		size and the current number of active adopters.

FINAL TIME  = 10
	~	Year
	~	The final time for the simulation.

	~	The initial time for the simulation.

	~	The frequency with which output is stored.
	|

TIME STEP  = 0.0625
	~	Year
	~	The time step for the simulation.
