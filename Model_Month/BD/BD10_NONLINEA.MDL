		This isa nonlinear Polya process model in which
		the probability of adding a stone of a given color to a jar is
		a function o the proportion of stones in the jar of that color.
		Chapter 10.
	|

White Stones Added per Period=
	Stones Added per Period*IF THEN ELSE(1 - Random Draw < Probability of Choosing a White Stone\
		,1,0)
	~	Stones/period
	~	The number of white stones added each period equals the number of stones \
		added each period when the complement of the random draw from a uniform \
		distribution on the interval [0, 1]  is less than  the probability of \
		choosing a white stone.
	|

Black Stones Added per Period=
	Stones Added per Period*IF THEN ELSE(Random Draw <= Probability of Choosing a Black Stone\
		,1,0)
	~	Stones/period
	~	The number of black stones added each period equals the number of stones \
		added each period when the random draw from a uniform distribution on the \
		interval [0, 1]  is less than or equal to the probability of choosing a \
		black stone.
	|

Probability of Choosing a White Stone=
	1/(1+exp(-Sensitivity to Proportion*(Proportion of White Stones-0.5)))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The probability of choosing a stone of a given color is a function of the \
		proportion of stones of that color.  The exponential function is used.    \
		The probability of choosing each color is 1/2 when the proportion of \
		stones of that color is 1/2.
	|

Sensitivity to Proportion=
	10
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The larger this parameter, the faster the probability of choosing a  stone \
		of a given color increases with its proportion in the jar.
	|

Probability of Choosing a Black Stone=
	1/(1+exp(-Sensitivity to Proportion*(Proportion of Black Stones-0.5)))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The probability of choosing a stone of a given color is a function of the \
		proportion of stones of that color.  The exponential function is used.    \
		The probability of choosing each color is 1/2 when the proportion of \
		stones of that color is 1/2.
	|

Random Draw=
	RANDOM UNIFORM(0,1,Random number seed)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Each period a random number is drawn from the uniform distribuion on the \
		interval [0, 1].
	|

Random number seed=
	1000
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Ensures that the sequence of random numbers drawn in successive simulation \
		runs is the same.  Alter the seed to generate a different sequence of \
		realizations for the random process.
	|

Black Stones= INTEG (
	Black Stones Added per Period,
		Initial Black Stones)
	~	Stones
	~	The number of black stones in the jar.
	|

Initial Black Stones=
	1
	~	Stones
	~	There is one stone of each color in the jar to start.
	|

Initial White Stones=
	1
	~	Stones
	~	There is one stone of each color in the jar to start.
	|

Proportion of Black Stones=
	Black Stones/Total Number of Stones
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The proportion of black stones in the jar.
	|

Proportion of White Stones=
	White Stones/Total Number of Stones
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The proportion of white stones in the jar.
	|

Stones Added per Period=
	1
	~	Stones/period
	~	The number of stones added per period, equal to one in the traditional \
		model.
	|

Total Number of Stones=
	Black Stones + White Stones
	~	Stones
	~	The total number of stones in the jar.
	|

White Stones= INTEG (
	White Stones Added per Period,
		Initial White Stones)
	~	Stones
	~	The number of white stones in the jar.
