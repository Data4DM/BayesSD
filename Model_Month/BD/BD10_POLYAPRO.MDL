		Linear Polya Process Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the traditional linear Polya process model in which
		the probability of adding a stone of a given color to a jar is
		equal to the proportion of stones in the jar of that color.
		Chapter 10.

Random Draw=
	RANDOM UNIFORM(0,1,Random number seed)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Each period a random number is drawn from the uniform distribuion on the \
		interval [0, 1].
	|

Black Stones Added per Period=
	Stones Added per Period*IF THEN ELSE(Random Draw <= Proportion of Black Stones,1,0)
	~	Stones/period
	~	The number of black stones added each period equals the number of stones \
		added each period when the random draw from a uniform distribution on the \
		interval [0, 1]  is less than or equal to the proportion of blach stones \
		already in the jar.
	|

White Stones Added per Period=
	Stones Added per Period*IF THEN ELSE(1 - Random Draw < Proportion of White Stones,1,\
		0)
	~	Stones/period
	~	The number of white stones added each period equals the number of stones \
		added each period when the complement of the random draw from a uniform \
		distribution on the interval [0, 1]  is less than  the proportion of white \
		stones already in the jar.
	|

Random number seed=
	1000
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Ensures that the sequence of random numbers drawn in successive simulation \
		runs is the same.  Alter the seed to generate a different sequence of \
		realizations for the random process.

Proportion of Black Stones=
