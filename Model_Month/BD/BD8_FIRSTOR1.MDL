		This is the generic linear, first-order negative feedback
		system with an explicit goal.  Chapter 8.
	|

Net Inflow Rate=
	"Discrepancy (S* - S)"/AT Adjustment Time
	~	Units/Period
	~	The net inflow a fraction of the discrepancy between the desired and \
		actual state each period.  The adjustment time determines what fraction of \
		the gap is corrected each period.
	|

AT Adjustment Time=
	20
	~	Period
	~	The time period over which discrepancies between the desired and actual \
		state of the system are corrected.
	|

"Discrepancy (S* - S)"=
	"S* Desired State of the System" - S State of the System
	~	Units
	~	The gap between the desired and actual state of the system.
	|

"S* Desired State of the System"=
	100
	~	Units
	~	The desired, or goal state for the system.
	|

S State of the System= INTEG (
	Net Inflow Rate,
		Initial State of the System)
	~	Units
	~	The state of the system accumulates its net inflow rate.
	|

Initial State of the System=
	0
	~	Units
	~	The initial quantity in the stock.
