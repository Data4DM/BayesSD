********************************************************	.Richards********************************************************~				Richards Population Growth Model		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman				This is the classic Richards growth model (chapter 9).  The population		can be any quantity growing in a fixed environment. Varying the parameter m		yields different growth curves.	|Fractional Net Birth Rate=	Maximum Fractional Net Birth Rate * (1 - (Population/Carrying Capacity)^(m - 1))/(m \		- 1)	~	1/Period	~	The fractional net birth rate is a declining function of the population \		relative to carrying capacity.  The parameter m in the Richards model \		determines the strengh of the nonlinearity.	|m=	2	~	Dimensionless	~	The exponent in the Richards model, the parameter m determines the \		strength of the nonlinearity.  m = 2 is the logistic case.   m Å 1 \		approaches the Gompertz model (note:  division by zero results when m = 1).	|Carrying Capacity=	1	~	Individuals	~	The carrying capacity of the environment.  Defined as 1 for testing (100% \		of its value).	|Initial Population Fraction=	0.001	~	Dimensionless	~	The initial population as a fraction of the carrying capacity.	|Maximum Fractional Net Birth Rate=	1	~	1/Period	~	The maximum fractional growth rate is set to 1, thus scaling time so that \		1 time unit = 1/g* (yielding the standard logistic curve).	|Net Birth Rate=	Fractional Net Birth Rate * Population	~	Individuals/Period	~	The net birth rate is the product of the fractional net birth rate and \		population.	|Population= INTEG (	Net Birth Rate,		Initial Population Fraction * Carrying Capacity)	~	Individuals	~	The population accumulates the net birth rate.  Initialized to a fraction \		of the carrying capacity.	|********************************************************	.Control********************************************************~		Simulation Control Paramaters	|FINAL TIME  = 15	~	Period	~	The final time for the simulation.	|INITIAL TIME  = 0	~	Period	~	The initial time for the simulation.	|SAVEPER  =         TIME STEP	~	Period	~	The frequency with which output is stored.	|TIME STEP  = 0.125	~	Period	~	The time step for the simulation.	|\\\---/// Sketch information - do not modify anything except namesV300  Do not put anything below this section - it will be ignored*View 1$0,0,Helvetica|10|B|0-0-0|0-0-0|0-0-0|-1--1--1|-1--1--1|0,010,1,Population,377,105,40,20,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,012,2,48,214,105,8,8,0,3,0,0,-1,0,0,01,3,5,1,4,0,0,22,0,0,0,-1--1--1,,1|(311,105)|1,4,5,2,100,0,0,22,0,0,0,-1--1--1,,1|(247,105)|11,5,48,279,105,6,8,34,3,0,0,1,0,0,010,6,Net Birth Rate,279,133,40,20,40,3,0,0,-1,0,0,010,7,Carrying Capacity,368,332,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,010,8,Fractional Net Birth Rate,215,210,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,9,1,6,1,0,43,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(372,189)|1,10,8,6,1,0,43,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(215,174)|1,11,7,8,1,0,43,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(238,304)|1,12,1,8,1,0,45,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(393,228)|10,13,Maximum Fractional Net Birth Rate,103,270,45,26,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,14,13,8,1,0,43,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(146,238)|12,15,0,344,158,20,20,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0R12,16,0,302,227,20,20,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0B10,17,Initial Population Fraction,509,106,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,010,18,m,132,356,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,19,18,8,1,0,0,0,0,64,0,-1--1--1,,1|(161,267)|///---\\\:L<%^E!@
