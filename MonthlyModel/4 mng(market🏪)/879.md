## estimated 
- company goal for delivery delay
- capacity acquisition delay

- normal expansion pressure

## assumed
- cost per sales representative
### don't make normal_ one as estimated
- normal delivery delay (changing; references of the community; somewhere in the model )

- Single tech company
- driving is usually exogenous, but we can outsource part of the mechanism by replacing targeted simulated with driving data (outsource might be better if data is not too noisy)
- backlog, capacity, order rate, revenue, (not in driving cat)

- book to bill ratio := order/shipment

- process noise candidate: 

information of time series cannot be measurable , data series 
target ts is informative about parameter of interest.
