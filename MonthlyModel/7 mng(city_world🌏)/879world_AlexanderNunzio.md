- estimated params: labor force particiapation, inherent land fertility, potentially arable land, desired food ratio, technology development delay, desired family size, desired resource use rate, industrial capital output ratio
- 
- target simulated: human welfare, GDP
- normal distribution likelihood 
technology change rate is random and goal is to observe (if it is physical stock, add noise, first order control)
