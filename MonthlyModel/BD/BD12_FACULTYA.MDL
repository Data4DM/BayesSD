		A simple model of the aging chain for faculty at a university (chapter 12).
		Based on a model originally developed by David Peterson.
		Data from MIT.
		Hiring and promotion are exogenous.
	|

Total Faculty=
	 Assistant Professors + Associate Professors + Full Professors
	~	people
	~	The total faculty is the sum of the faculty at each rank.
	|

Full Professor Retirement Rate=
	DELAY3(Associate Promotion Rate,Average Full Professor Service Time)
	~	people/Year
	~	Full professors are assumed to retire after an average service time; a \
		third-order delay is assumed.
	|

Assistant Departure Rate=
	 Assistant Review Rate * ( 1 - Assistant Promotion Fraction )
	~	people/Year
	~	A fraction of the assistant professors reviewed are promoted; the rest \
		leave.
