		Pricing Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This partial model represents price setting as an adaptive process.
		For documentation, see chapter 20.  In this partial model, unit costs and 
		the demand/supply balance are exogenous for testing purposes.
	|

Change in Traders' Expected Price=
	(Indicated Price - Traders' Expected Price)/Time to Adjust Traders' Expected Price
	~	$/Unit/Year
	~	Traders' beliefs about the underlying equilibrium price adjust in response \
		to the gap between the indicated price and the current belief.  Expected \
		underlying price adjusts via first-order adaptive expectations to the \
		actual price, constrained to be greater than a minimum level.
	|

Effect of Costs on Price=
	1+Sensitivity of Price to Costs*((Expected Production Costs/Traders' Expected Price)\
		-1)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Price responds to the gap between traders' beliefs about the underlying \
		equilibrium price and their beliefs about the costs of production.  When \
		expected costs rise above the expected price, prices tend to rise, and \
		vice versa.
	|

Effect of Inventory Coverage on Price=
	Relative Inventory Coverage^Sensitivity of Price to Inventory Coverage
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Price rises when inventory coverage is less than normal, and falls when it \
		is greater.  The Sensitivity of Price to Inventory Coverage controls the \
		magnitude of the response.
	|

Expected Production Costs=
	Initial Price*(1+(STEP(0,1)-STEP(0,400)))
	~	$/Unit
	~	Expected Production Costs represent beliefs among market participants \
		about the unit costs of production (variable and fixed, including normal \
		profit margins).  Expected Costs therefore represent beliefs about what a \
		'fair' price would be, or the long-run equilibrium price.  Expected costs \
		adjust to the actual costs with a delay representing the time required for \
		gain information and adjust beliefs about costs.  Exogenous for partial \
		model test.
	|

Indicated Price=
	MAX(Minimum Price,Price)
	~	$/Unit
	~	Beliefs about the underlying equilibrium price are never less than a \
		minimum price level capturing the variable costs of goods.
	|

Initial Price=
	100
	~	$/Unit
	~	The initial price of the commodity.  Used to initialize unit costs and \
		price expectations so the system begins in equilibrium.
	|

Inventory Coverage=
	Reference Inventory Coverage*(1+STEP(-0.25,1)-STEP(-0.25,700)-STEP(0.52,1200))
	~	Years
	~	Exogenous  input for partial model test
	|

Minimum Price=
	Unit Variable Cost
	~	$/Unit
	~	Trader's do not believe prices can fall below the variable cost per unit \
		of production.
	|

Price=
	Traders' Expected Price*Effect of Inventory Coverage on Price*Effect of Costs on Price
	~	$/Unit
	~	Trader's set prices by adjusting their belief about the underlying \
		equilibrium price in response to market pressures such as the \
		supply/demand balance, here represented by inventory coverage relative to \
		the normal level, and unit costs.
	|

Reference Inventory Coverage= INITIAL(
	0.2)
	~	Years
	~	The normal inventory coverage required to ensure desired levels of service \
		(the desired ability to fill orders).
	|

Relative Inventory Coverage=
	Inventory Coverage/Reference Inventory Coverage
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Inventory coverage relative to the normal level needed to ensure desired \
		service levels in the market.
	|

Sensitivity of Price to Costs=
	0.5
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Controls the response of price to discrepancies between the expected price \
		and the expected cost of production.
	|

Sensitivity of Price to Inventory Coverage=
	-1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Controls the response of price to inventory coverage.  Must be negative \
		for high inventory to lead to lower prices.  Higher absolute values lead \
		to greater price changes for any given inventory coverage level.
	|

Time to Adjust Traders' Expected Price=
	1
	~	Years
	~	Trader's belief about the underlying equilibrium price adjust to actual \
		prices over this period.
	|

Traders' Expected Price= INTEG (
	Change in Traders' Expected Price,
		Initial Price)
	~	$/Unit
	~	The price market makers and traders believe would clear the market if \
		demand and supply were in balance, and no other pressures to change price \
		existed.
	|

Unit Variable Cost=
	60
	~	$/Unit
	~	Unit Variable Costs of production are exogenous.  A variety of test inputs \
		allow users to try different patterns, including a step, pulse, sine wave, \
		and random noise.
