		This model represents the growth of a population relative to its 
		carrying capacity.  The carrying capacity can be variable, either
		regenerated or consumed/degraded by the population.
		
		With suitable parameters the model can generate pure exponential
		growth, exponential decay, s-shaped growth, s-shaped growth with
		oscillation around the equlibrium, and overshoot and collapse.

Instructions=

	~	Dimensionless
	~	Generic Population and Carrying Capacity Model
		
		Parameters for different basic modes of behavior:
		
		S-shaped growth:
			Base case parameters
		Pure exponential growth:
			Initial Carrying Capacity = 1e12
		Pure exponential decay:
			Initial Carrying Capacity = 1e12
			Maximum Fractional Birth Rate < Maximum Fractional Death Rate (e.g. 0.01 and 0.02, 		\
		respectively).
		S-shaped growth with overshoot and oscillation:
			Switch for Maturation Delay = 1
		Overshoot and Collapse:
			Resource Consumption per Capita > 0.  Good values are around 0.01
	|

Maturation Delay=
	20
	~	Year
	~	The average maturation delay.
	|

Switch for Maturation Delay=
	0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	1 = Maturation Delay between births and entering the population.  0 = no \
		maturation delay.
	|

Maximum Fractional Birth Rate=
	0.04
	~	1/Year
	~	The maximum fractional net birth rate.
	|

Minimum Fractional Death Rate=
	0.01
	~	1/Year
	~	The minimum fractional death rate.
	|

Carrying Capacity= INTEG (
	+Regeneration of Carrying Capacity-Degradation of Carrying Capacity,
		Initial Carrying Capacity)
	~	People
	~	The carrying capacity defines the equilibrium or maximum sustainable \
		population.   It is consumed and degraded by the population and can also \
		regenerate.
	|

Constant Regeneration Rate=
	0
	~	People/Year
	~	Exogenous constant regeneration rate, set by the user.
	|

Degradation of Carrying Capacity=
	MIN(Maximum Degradation of Carrying Capacity, Population * Resource Consumption per Capita\
		)
	~	People/Year
	~	The carrying capacity of the environment is consumed or degraded in \
		proportion to the population.  The minimum function ensures that \
		degradation falls to zero as the carrying capacity falls to zero (carrying \
		capacity can never be negative).
	|

Initial Carrying Capacity=
	1e+006
	~	People
	~	The initial carrying capacity of the environment.
	|

Maximum Degradation of Carrying Capacity=
	Carrying Capacity/Minimum Degradation Time
	~	People/Year
	~	The maximum degradation rate is determined by the carrying capacity and \
		the minimum degradation time.  This formulation captures the fact that the \
		carrying capacity must remain nonnegative and that damage to the \
		environment falls as there is less undamaged environment remaining.
	|

Minimum Degradation Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	The minimum time constant for the degradation of the environment.
	|

Regeneration of Carrying Capacity=
	Constant Regeneration Rate
	~	People/Year
	~	Regeneration of the carrying capacity.  Equal to a constant rate set by \
		the user.
	|

Resource Consumption per Capita=
	0
	~	People/Person/Year
	~	Resource consumption per capita, expressed in people-equivalent units of \
		carrying capacity consumed per person per year.
	|

Birth Rate=
	Switch for Maturation Delay*DELAY3( Fractional Birth Rate*Population, Maturation Delay\
		 ) + (1 - Switch for Maturation Delay) * Fractional Birth Rate * Population
	~	People/Year
	~	Births are proportional to the population.  When the Switch for Maturation \
		Delay  = 0, those born immediately add to the population and can  \
		reproduce, die, and consumer the carrying capacity.  When the switch = 1, \
		there is a third-order maturation delay with an average delay time of the \
		Maturation Delay before births enter the population stock.
	|

Population Relative to Carrying Capacity=
	Population/Carrying Capacity
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ratio of population to carrying capacity determines the fractional \
		birth and death rates.
	|

Fractional Birth Rate=
	 Maximum Fractional Birth Rate*(1-(1/(1+exp(-7*(Population Relative to Carrying Capacity\
		-1)))))
	~	1/Year
	~	The fractional birth rate is a declining function of the population \
		relative to the carrying capacity.  A logistic function is used.
	|

Fractional Death Rate=
	Minimum Fractional Death Rate*(1+Population Relative to Carrying Capacity^2)
	~	1/Year
	~	The fractional death rate is an increasing function of the ratio of \
		population to carrying capacity.  A power function is assumed.
	|

Initial Population=
	1000
	~	People
	~	The initial population.
	|

Death Rate = Fractional Death Rate*Population
	~	People/Year
	~	Deaths are proportional to the population.
	|

Net Birth Rate = Birth Rate-Death Rate
	~	People/Year
	~	The net birth rate is births less deaths.
	|

Net Fractional Birth Rate = Fractional Birth Rate-Fractional Death Rate
	~	1/Year
	~	The net fractional birth rate is fractional births less fractional deaths.
	|

Population= INTEG (
	Birth Rate-Death Rate,
		Initial Population)
	~	People
	~	The population is increased by births and decreased by deaths.
