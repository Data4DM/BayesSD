## What
1. Can 游댴 Statistical forecasting (SF) and 游릭  Causal Policy (CP) model conversate with each other?

2. Can 游댴 practical theoretician and 游릭 theoretical practitioner collaborate?

3. Can 游댴 dynamic system society with 游릭  system dynamics society connected?

3 causes 2 which causes 1 and we aim to address this by proposing a bridge between 游댴 and 游릭. Fortunate enough to be working with both camp's leader (e.g. 游댴: Andrew Gelman and Aki Vehtari (hopefully Tamara Broderick) from Bayesian computation society, 游릭: John Sterman and Hazhir Rahmandad from System dynamics society) I am in the ideal position to initiate this bridging attempts.


## How
Subprojects are documented in [this](https://github.com/users/hyunjimoon/projects/2 ) project board and the purpose of this project boards is to list required works for code-based platform where prior knowledge, data, algorithms from two sides are explicitly represented and compared. Setting the language that is acceptable to each sides' language is the very first job. 

Listing sources of uncertainty and their interaction is the most important job. Then we map the sources between two worlds游댴 游릭. It first attempt is in progress in [Uncertainty Structure of Dynamic Models: Capturing Prey and Demand with Predator and Supply](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/DataInDM/issues/2)

In the end, combining functionalities that each community excels in (e.g. 游댴: automated short term forecast, 游릭: descriptive, policy-based) we aim to suggest `how to making noise-resilient choice` in modularized fashion.

I need your help! Will you contribute? Yes or no? Please feel free to ask any questions regarding the project as I can provide data to aid your decision. 

## Why 
1. Reverse Copernican heliocentrism in Galilei (1632) "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems"

Contrary to Copernican heliocentrism which rebelled against human's self-centeredness, we suggest recovering this spirit. The root of this difference can be found in reductionism vs constructionism or science vs simulation. We build model for the purpose of catering our own needs (`decision`) on the world we perceive (`draw`). Based on this demand, we search for the supply of real world's `data`. As a homage to "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", our goal can be named as "Dialogue Bridging Two Constructive Systems along Decision, Draws, Data". The two systems are 游댴 SF and 游릭  CP model. 

2. Specify Kahneman (2011) "Thinking fast and slow" 
We interpret fast and slow as 游댴 SF's short term forecast and 游릭  CP's long term forecast, both of which collaborate to optimize policy. When thinking fast, we act with experience-based intuition which is same as how游댴 SF propagates uncertainty with pre-estimated parameter with historical data. Disadvantage of 游댴, e.g. inability to extrapolate, is complemented by 游릭 's causal structure that has both explainability and outlasting effect via embedded mechanism.
