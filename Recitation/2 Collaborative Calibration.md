### Dynamics modeling and statistical modeling 
- Oliiva20 introduce two cultures of explainability: variation and process

### Six packages
1. perceive and programming `Demand` Vensim-SDA 
2. compute scientific `Draws` Stan-SBC 
3. collect supporting `Data` BATS-SOPS

## How
### Modular design
Given a system, we aim for modular design in consistency check which requires two: modular decomposition of the system and a testing system that can detect which submodule caused the problem (breached consistency).

Subprojects are documented in [this](https://github.com/users/hyunjimoon/projects/2 ) project board and the purpose of this project boards is to list required works for code-based platform where prior knowledge, data, algorithms from two sides are explicitly represented and compared. Setting the language that is acceptable to each sides' language is the very first job. 

Listing sources of uncertainty and their interaction is the most important job. Then we map the sources between two worldsðŸ”º ðŸŸ¢. It first attempt is in progress in [Uncertainty Structure of Dynamic Models: Capturing Prey and Demand with Predator and Supply](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/DataInDM/issues/2)

In the end, combining functionalities that each community excels in (e.g. ðŸ”º: automated short term forecast, ðŸŸ¢: descriptive, policy-based) we aim to suggest `how to making noise-resilient choice` in modularized fashion.
