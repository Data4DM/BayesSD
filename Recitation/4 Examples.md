## What
- Classify variables according to its 
	- semantic (time, ratio, rate, level) where `parameters` are usually time or ratio
	- SD_syntax (`exo`/`endo`, assumed/estimated `parameter` for `exo` and observed/simulated `level` and latent for `endo`)
	- Bayes_syntax (data, transformed data, parameters, transformed parameters, model, generated quantities)

- Understand them in generalized linear regression context: assumed/ data observed state Y and predictor X (driving data and values of assumed parameter) 
- Understand how causal and feedback structure is affected by Bayesian inference
- Understand the role of parameter inference in terms of model calibration (first counting Ring-Toss-Success ratio then using SBC)
 

## How

We start with a simple prey-preditor Lotka Voltera (LV) model and compare with demand-supply (DS) model to understand three sources of uncertainty. Then we observe the effect of hierarchy and how it affects uncertainty of parameter, measurement, and process.


### M1: Prey-Predator (LV)
- 

### M2: Demand-Supply (DS): short time, Different space


### M3: Diffusion (SIR, COVID): Long time, Different space


### M4: Hierarchical Model
