## AR = AW
equation is for modular model building
competitors, cannibalization, churn, fixed attractiveness, potential adoption fixed

AD: Total ad spending, fraction to p conversion rate
AR = AD + AW
- scarcity increase desirability
- what would be the vaccine in this story? Going one step futher what might be the vaccine misinformation?
- Kyle's comment on desirability by restricting the exposure rate be paralleled to vaccine?

- regarding Kyle's comment on Facebook strategy which separates exposed and infected and John's analogy of epidemic model, can Facebook's strategy be anaologized to vaccine effect? 
- But the goal is completely different as Facebook aims to increase the infected population in the end, but vaccine aims to deter infection. Does this mean early vaccine could have make epidemic more severe in the long run? Or is this where the analogy breaks?


- It prevents viral impact by decreasing suceptible fraction which further decreases exposure rate in [[mng(diffusion)]]

$c_t = c= (q_t/q_0)^(-\lambda)$

- goes up larger compared to what it would have been otherwise
