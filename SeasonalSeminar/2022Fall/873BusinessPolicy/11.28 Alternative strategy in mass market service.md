- HW: e-scooter startup and estimation focused
- service has large fluctuation, cannot have more than two jobs, 
- low-cost service jobs (> 14 milion retail), median salary $10/hr, less insured leading to 
- are poor jobs inevitable in low-tech service sectors (forced to adopt strategy)
- social saftegy net, different companies casestudy 
	- quiktrip having twice avg salary, low turnover rates (stay 8 years avg), price competitive w. walmart
	- marcadona (3.8% turnover, childcare and training program, 85% full time compared to 40% industry avg), costco, trader joes
- theory 1: coincidental (successful *despite* offering ) - doing as they  VS theory 2: *integral* to successful strartegy other firms unable/unwilling to follow
- boundary conditions for profitability of incorporating good jobs in service (parking attendance)
	- contagious high quality employees
	- policy: empower employees to cost reduction cost, expericen impovement (disseminate improvements), cross train
	- endogenous mechanism: no layoff from fluctuation (productive during low demand), turnover reduction keep high quality and processes

- service quality, service capacity (employees * avg (skill * contribution opportunity)), job attractiveness
- task richness (engage, cross train) X compensation; performance landscape. CMIN: high turnover, low labor quality, low capability VS IMAX: low turnover, high labor quality, high capability

### fixed demand
- Main features affecting whther CMIN VS IMAX are: employee quality, service quality, task richness, learning rate
- Peak location sensitivity to context 
	- scenario 1: less synergy (optimal employee quality decrease)
	- scenario 2: no learning or training (instead of training - need to pay more)
	- scenario 3: less benefit from quality
- CMIN has easier template, locally dominant, 
- For IMAX: need two nontrival things (high task richness, cross training, buffer, stable schedule, opportunity for layors - motivation, compensation peak); imitating IMAX is difficult

### variable demand: with buffers (no JIT), we can reclaim IMAX
- just in time scheduling combined with variability (jobs become hectic, cannot keep high quality)
- slow down labor adjustment with reliable schedule (buffer creation): JIT sucks!!

## transition dynamics
- worse before better dynamics (should pay more before get better quality - couple of years for effect to kick in)
- temporal complexity misleads managers towards CMIN and complicates incentive toward IMAX  (delay)

## experiment
- 96 time series decision for experiment subject (Hazhir and S. Gary; delay impair learning and can drive convergence to inefficient strategy)
- noisy outcome -> more ppl end up in the middle
- longer delay -> CMIN >> IMAX

- hard to persuade there are high quality employees out there (rejecting applicants), public question, attribution
- trust between manager and employees
- task richness

- employees doesn't wait for worse than better dynamics (narrow band)
- store manager VS HQ.
- accepting periods of loss (when low demand)
- different direction of task standardization and richness
- letting local stores have veto power to HQ
- herd behavior in an uncertain environment
