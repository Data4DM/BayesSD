- calibration/parameter estimation
- nonlinear regression (time delay, nonlinearities, accumulations, missing data, autocorrelations, hetereoskedasticity) -> method of least squares, method of simulated moments
- e.g. VCR (three series of sales, price, adopters) which has installed base (includes learning curve), SIR model, price 
- how sensitive is the payoff function for calibration to changes in parameters

- use smallest calibration probems possible (e.g. learning curve = cumulative production)
## 
1. out of sample prediction (e.g. covid)
2. modeling human growth and weigh dynamics (not used in the model) e.g. 
3. synthetic data (add process and measurement noise to the model) - covid: acuity (estimated on synthetic data)
	1. have ground truth
	2. p% coverage to p% coverage

Accumulated structural bias: endogeneity, processs, measurement noise
account for noise coming in

- define policy function; u = P(s,r)
- better save (high level of capability, )
- turn on and off is better; don't continue production (invest in bringing crews; produce)
