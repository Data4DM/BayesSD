# rule of 70
- dP/dt = (B-D) = bP - dP = (b-d)P = gP, ln2/g = .7/g (70/g in percentage)
- investment of x percent per year divide 70 with the fractional growth rate (rule of 70)
- 반감기 = ln2/k (reaction coefficient which is temperature dependent)

- greenhouse gas (h20 gas, CO2)
- heat (sunlight inflow and outgoing )
- more water evaporation, more green house gas
- average temperature about the earth, heat or energy (capture temperature); sunlight inflow and radiation outflow

increase temperature; tundra biomass; emission
warmer temperature, under frozen increase green house gases

- as temperature goes up, more air conditiong, increases energy production
## ☁️ cloud challenge
- capacity of sinks changes (gas is observed in ocean but not forever)

- aggressive automaker leasing created new competitors (we created superstores)

- should collect data for how ppl buy new cars 
- policy recommendations were developing new clinics to assess consumer tradeoffs of new vs off-lease/used vehicles
- move to longer terms (> 3yr)
- reduce subvention
