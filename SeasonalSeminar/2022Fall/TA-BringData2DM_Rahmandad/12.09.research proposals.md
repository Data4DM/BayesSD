Andy, Rosa: workflow

Jason, Celia: 
- impact of multiple impuation (systematic bias)
- multiverse analysis ()
- including and excluding unit of analysis shift model and change ui?
- randomization effect in simulation-testing: exchangability 

## Hierarchical model application
Arya :
- leverage point in unit vs district (school mng strategy)
- estimation help us **identify conditions** for district-level >> school-level (using estimation to )

cathy:
- identify proper allocation of policies to discourage fradulent behavior
- 

## identifiability and value of data 
Alban:
- target variable design based on first step optimization (how should we spend our time for data collection)
- min number of target variable to estimate 


## incorporating soft ideas in modeling
- qualitative (positive slope) trend 
- proxy variables
