- identifying modes of behavior using sensitivity analysis
- baseline and other sensitivity (can input prior draws from the following)
- avoid serial table function (convolution), set model in equilibrium at normal point
- parameterize table functions for sensitivity testing 
- can normalizing the input and output make the s-shape more symmetric?

- allowing to track other stocks (e.g. obesity weight) ppl and their wiegith , workers and their experience, factories energy efficiency, tasks and error
- Take out characteristic from its stock with the “average” density (exceptions need careful treatment, e.g. Rahmandad and Hu (2010))

Efforts to make lookup more analytic is parallel to (symmetric latent_data and parameter)
- difference of sensitivity analysis of `SWEffxyz` and `xyz`?

1 consumer and 2 producer, 
- T as total demand, C1 and C2 producer capa, P1, P2 is price, Q1, Q2 
i) c1 + c2 >< T
ii) p1 ><  p2
| -   | p1 > p2 | p2 > p1 |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| T>    |         |         |
| T<    |         |         |

Allocation mechanism: robust m to n formulation (solve when demand and supply )

- energy going in and out five to five allocation.
- allocation is based on subscript (allocation by priority)
- capacity is not regarded so nested if then else becomes messy
