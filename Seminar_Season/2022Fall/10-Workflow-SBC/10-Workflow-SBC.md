- My talk and slide on BayesWF with the following abstract:
	- "what" problems to solve and "how" to solve with one's and community's resources. 
	- This would help you to classify the concepts on model misspecification, coding error, inaccurate computation. 
	- I am particularly interested in simulation-based calibration where the as a whole is tested and updated based on the simulated parameters' posterior coverage.

- explain how each source of uncertainty can be formulated in Bayesian experiment for the model checking and expansion.
