Compared to `outer_circle`, approximator+analytical (A) is more emphasized, making `inner_circle` computaitional statistics topic, rather than social science or business. Code can be re-organized into three steps: analyze, infer, action:

## 1. Analyze
### StockFlowDiag
### 7_StrucDomAnal

## 2. Infer
### 1_MLE
### 2_MSM
### 3_SEM
### 4_FLT
### 5_MCMC

## 3. Action
### 6_BATS
### 8_SOPS
