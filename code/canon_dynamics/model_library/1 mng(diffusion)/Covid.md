- difference btw black one and the other loop?
- basic reproduction factor (R0 = beta; covid 2~6); beta  (eff. contact, no. of ppl that I can affect) = C (contacts per day)*q(mask) * z; 
- R0 assumes every population as susceptible, $R_t$ (effective reproductive # R0 * suceptible fraction (S/N) determines behavior < 1; vaccination, testing, isolation (should do test)
- how does S/N decrease? susceptible to recovered; vaccination 
- After estimation beta, rho, I0, calculate delta (fatality rate = 0. 1%), R0
- beta[Vx], beta[NVx], covid is partially immune 
- presym: infected but don't have symptoms yet (in two days infected) > asym
- exposed ()
