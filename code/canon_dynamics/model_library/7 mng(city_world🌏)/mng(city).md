- 100 parameter
- data for characteristic of unemployed, managerial-professional, labor are hard to find
- no data for stock

## driving variables
family size 3, housing poppulation density 3, construction labor 1, business labor 1, managers required (new, )

hard bc level of aggregation is high but variable is tangible

driving is overlapping with assumed parameters (depending on time-aggregation )

highly aggregated model - flow data is hard to get, rather stock data is easier

## target variable
labor, worker housing, new enterprises, mature businesses, declining industry (unemployed, manger professional, population, premium housing, underemp housing)

- artificially calculate difference over stocks can be one solution for the above challenge
- hard to find from literature as they have different aggregation
- good parameters are scale free (e.g. discrete, continuous time)

## process noise
- labor arrival
