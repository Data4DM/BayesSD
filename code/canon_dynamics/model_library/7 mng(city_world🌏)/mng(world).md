## process noise in tech change rate
- modeling tech is different, process noise - autocorrelated (boom and bust, path-dep)

## measurement noise
- death, birth, gdp, nonrenewable resource


when population decreases, it is usually bc of ppl dying -> do causal tracing. e.g. bottleneck changes (pollution, industrial)

fewer target variables, 

## target variable (if I had this data, I would be able to identify estimated params) - don't go over 5
- birth and death (-> population is redundant)
- food (collect data from different sectors of model uniformly; otherwise)
- life expectancy, industral and service output

- GDP per capita (target variable, ): distribution over time (NOT across different countries -)
