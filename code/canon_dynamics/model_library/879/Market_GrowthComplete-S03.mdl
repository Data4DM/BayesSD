		Market Growth Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the version of Forrester's (1968) Market Growth Model
		developed in chapter 15.  The company goal for delivery delay is
		fixed, and market potential is unlimited.
		
		The model includes switches to decouple the sectors and allow 
		partial model testing.
	|

Pressure to Expand Capacity=
	Switch for Endogenous Pressure*((Delivery Delay Perceived by Company)/Company Goal for Delivery Delay\
		) + (1-Switch for Endogenous Pressure
	)*Exogenous Pressure for Expansion
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Pressure to expand capacity arises when the perceived delivery delay is \
		greater than the firm's goal for delivery delay.  The Switch for \
		Endogenous Pressure allows expansion pressure to be made exogenous for \
		testing purposes.
	|

Backlog= INTEG (
	Order Rate-Shipment Rate,
		Initial Backlog)
	~	Units
	~	The backlog of unfilled orders.
	|

Book to Bill Ratio=
	Order Rate/Shipment Rate
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The book to bill ratio is a common measure of the health of high-tech \
		companies.
	|

Exogenous Delivery Delay=
	Normal Delivery Delay
	~	Months
	~	Exogenous delivery delay for model testing purposes.  Inclues a variety of \
		step inputs.
	|

Exogenous Order Rate=
	500
	~	Units/Month
	~	Exogenous order rate for model testring.
	|

Exogenous Pressure for Expansion=
	Normal Expansion Pressure
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Exogenous pressure for expansion is based on the normal value and adjusted \
		by avariety of step functions for testing purposes.
	|

Exogenous Sales Effectiveness=
	Normal Sales Effectiveness
	~	Units/(Month*Person)
	~	Exogenous sales effectiveness for model testing.  Includes a step input.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness=
	1
	~	Dimensionless [0,1]
	~	1 = Sales Effectiveness determined by delivery delay.
		0 = Sales Effectiveness is exogenous for testing purposes.
	|

Delivery Delay=
	Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay*(Backlog/Shipment Rate) +  (1-Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay\
		)*Exogenous Delivery Delay
	~	Month
	~	Delivery delay is the rato of backlog to shipments.  For model testing \
		purposes, delivery delay can be set to an exogenous value.
	|

Initial Capacity= INITIAL(
	Initial Backlog/Company Goal for Delivery Delay)
	~	Units/Month
	~	Initial capacity is set to be in equilibrium wtih initial Backlog and \
		Company's goal for delivery delay.
	|

Switch for Capacity Constraint=
	1
	~	Dimensionless [0,1]
	~	1 = shipments determined by capacity and capacity utilization.  0 = \
		shipments always equal desired production, which keeps the delivery delay \
		constant at the normal value.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Delivery Delay=
	1
	~	Dimensionless [0,1]
	~	1 = delivery delay determined by backlog and shipments.   0 = delivery \
		delay determined exogenously.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Switch for Capacity Constraint*Capacity*Capacity Utilization+(1-Switch for Capacity Constraint\
		)*Desired Production
	~	Units/Month
	~	Shipments can be constrained by capacity or set equal to the desired rate.  \
		Setting the Switch for Capacity Constraint to 1 means shipments are \
		determined by capacity and capacity utilization.  When the switch is zero, \
		shipments always equal the rate that keeps the delivery delay constant at \
		the normal value.
	|

Sales Effectiveness=
	Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness*(Normal Sales Effectiveness*Effect of Delivery Delay on Sales Effectiveness\
		) + (1-Switch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness)*Exogenous Sales Effectiveness
	~	Units/Month/Person
	~	Sales effectiveness is determined by the delivery delay for the product \
		(when theSwitch for Endogenous Sales Effectiveness = 1).  Otherwise it is \
		exogenous for model testing.
	|

Switch for Endogenous Pressure=
	1
	~	Dimensionless [0,1]
	~	1 = Expansion pressure determined by perceived delivery delay and the \
		delivery delay goal.  0 = exogenous expansion pressure.
	|

	~	Units
	~	The initial backlog is one unit.

		are exogenous.
	|

Order Rate=
	Switch for Endogenous Orders*Sales Force*Sales Effectiveness+(1-Switch for Endogenous Orders\
		)*Exogenous Order Rate
	~	Units/Month
	~	Orders are determined by the sales force and sales force effetiveness when \
		the Switch for Endogenous Orders = 1.  Setting the switch to 0 cuts the \
		sales growth feedback for partial model testing purposes.
	|

		adequate.
	|

Capacity=
	SMOOTH3I(Desired Capacity,Capacity Acquisition Delay,Initial Capacity)
	~	Units/Month

		availability.  First order smoothing is assumed.
	|

		)
	~	Months
	~	The delivery delay perceived by the market lags behind the quotes given by \

		First-order smoothing is assumed.
	|

Desired Capacity=

	~	Units/Month
	~	Desired capacity is anchored on current capacity, then adjusted up or down \
		based on the pressure for expansion the firm recognizes.
