		This is the generic structure for adaptive expectations (first-order exponential
		smoothing).  Chapter 11
	|

Adjustment Time=
	7
	~	Day
	~	The time constant or delay time for the adjustment of the perceived input \
		to the reported value.
	|

Change in Perceived Value=
	"Error (Reported Value - Perceived Value)"/Adjustment Time
	~	Units/Day
	~	The perceived state of the system adjusts in proportion to the error, or \
		gap between the actual and perceived value of the input.
	|

"Error (Reported Value - Perceived Value)"=
	"Input: Reported Value of Variable (X)"-"Output: Perceived Value of Input"
	~	Units
	~	The error is the gap between the reported and perceived value of the input.
	|

"Input: Reported Value of Variable (X)"=
	RANDOM NORMAL(20,200,100,25,1000)
	~	Units
	~	The reported value of the input is exogenous for testing purposes.   The \
		input is set to a normally distributed random variable with mean 100 and \
		standard deviation 25 units.
	|

"Output: Perceived Value of Input"= INTEG (
	Change in Perceived Value,
		100)
	~	Units
	~	The output of adaptive expectations is a stock representing the perceived \
		state of the system.
