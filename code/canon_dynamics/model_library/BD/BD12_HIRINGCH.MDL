		Hiring Chain Model

		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model represents a two-stage hiring/promotion chain for workers in a firm
		where new hires are less productive than experienced workers.  Chapter 12.
	|

Assimilation Rate=
	Rookie Employees/Assimilation Time
	~	People/Week
	~	The rate at which rookie employees are assimilated into the ranks of the \
		fully productive, experienced workers.
	|

Assimilation Time=
	100
	~	Week
	~	The average time required to become an experienced worker.
	|

Average Productivity=
	Potential Output/Total Employees
	~	Units/Week/Person
	~	Average productivity of the workforce.
	|

Exogenous Growth Rate 0=
	0
	~	1/Week
	~	The exogenous growth rate for the total workforce.
	|

Experienced Employees= INTEG (
	Assimilation Rate-Experienced Quit Rate,
		1000)
	~	People
	~	The number of experienced (fully productive) employees
	|

Experienced Productivity=
	1
	~	Units/(Week*Person)
	~	The productivity of experienced workers.  Set to 1 in this test model.
	|

Experienced Quit Fraction=
	0.002
	~	1/Week
	~	The fraction of the experienced workers quitting each week.
	|

Experienced Quit Rate=
	Experienced Employees*Experienced Quit Fraction
	~	People/Week
	~	Experienced workers quit at a given fractional rate.
	|

Growth Rate=
	STEP(Exogenous Growth Rate 0, Growth Start Time 0)
	~	1/Week
	~	The exogenous growth rate for the total labor force.
	|

Growth Start Time 0=
	5
	~	Week
	~	The time at which the exogenous growth in workforce begins.
	|

Potential Output=
	Experienced Productivity*(Rookie Productivity Fraction*Rookie Employees +  Experienced Employees\
		)
	~	Units/Week
	~	Potential output is the rate at which the workforce can complete tasks \
		given the number of each type of worker and their productivity.
	|

Rookie Employees= INTEG (
	+Rookie Hire Rate-Assimilation Rate-Rookie Quit Rate,
		Experienced Employees*Experienced Quit Fraction*Assimilation Time)
	~	People
	~	Rookies are inexpeerienced new hires.  Set to the initial equilibrium \
		value.
	|

Rookie Fraction=
	Rookie Employees/Total Employees
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of the workforce consisting of inexperienced workers.
	|

Rookie Hire Rate=
	Growth Rate*Total Employees + Total Quit Rate
	~	People/Week
	~	The hire rate is set to replace all quits and grow the total labor force \
		at an exogenous fractional growth rate.
	|

Rookie Productivity Fraction=
	0.25
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The average productivity of new employees.
	|

Rookie Quit Fraction=
	0.01
	~	1/Week
	~	The fraction of the rookies quitting each week.
	|

Rookie Quit Rate=
	Rookie Employees*Rookie Quit Fraction
	~	People/Week
	~	Rookies quit at a given fractional rate.
	|

Total Employees=
	Rookie Employees + Experienced Employees
	~	People
	~	Total employees includes rookies and experienced staff.
	|

Total Quit Rate=
	Rookie Quit Rate + Experienced Quit Rate
	~	People/Week
	~	The total quite rate, including rookies and experienced workers.
