		The SI Model of Infectious Disease
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the SI (Susceptible-Infectious) model of infectious disease.
		Infectious individuals never recover and remain infectious forever,
		hence this is a model of chronic infection.  It is equivalent to the
		logistic population growth model.
		
		It is initialized with a population of 10000.
	|

Infection Rate=
	(Susceptible Population S*Infectivity i*Contact Rate c)*Infectious Population I/Total Population N
	~	People/Day
	~	The infection rate is the total number of encounters Sc multiplied by the \
		probability that any of those encounters is with an infectious individual \
		I/N, and finally multiplied by the probability that an encounter with an \
		infectious person results in infection i.
	|

Total Population N=
	10000
	~	People
	~	N is the total population in the community
	|

Contact Rate c=
	2
	~	1/Day
	~	People in the community interact at a certain rate (the Contact Rate, c, \
		measured in people contacted per person per time period, or 1/time \
		periods).
	|

Infectious Population I= INTEG (
	Infection Rate,
		Initial Infectious Population)
	~	People
	~	The total population of the community or region considered is divided into \
		two categories:  those susceptible to the disease, S, and those who are \
		infectious, I
	|

Initial Infectious Population=
	1
	~	People
	~	The initial number of infectious people.
	|

Infectivity i=
	0.5
	~	fraction
	~	The infectivity (i) of the disease is the probability that a person will \
		become infected after exposure to someone with the disease.
	|

Susceptible Population S= INTEG (
	-Infection Rate,
		1000)
	~	People
	~	The total population of the community or region considered is divided into \
		two categories:  those susceptible to the disease, S, and those who are \
		infectious, I
