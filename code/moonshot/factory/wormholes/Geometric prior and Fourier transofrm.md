> As it turns out, many fundamental differential operators such as the Laplacian are described as convolutions on Euclidean domains. Since such differential operators can be defined intrinsically over very general geometries, this provides a formal procedure to extend Fourier transforms beyond Euclidean domains, including graphs, groups and manifolds. We will discuss this in detail in Section 4.4.

> An essential aspect of Fourier transforms is that they reveal global properties of the signal and the domain, such as smoothness or conductance.
