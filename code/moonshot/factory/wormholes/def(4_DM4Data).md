- how dynamic models are perceived and introduced to ML and SL 
e.g. diffusion model (from genify and Jackie's), temporal GAN's attempt to enforce causal structure into network

- contrary to how data is introduced to dynamic models (but how?)
Data4DM is from science to statistics whereas DM4Data is statistics to science.
