- dynamic hypothesis: how is / should organization be run?

- it might be difficulat to use arviz (groups of xarray) as it forces to have the same chain, draws within one dataset (although they could differe for e.g. `prior`, `posterior` group); filling zero fro non-existant can work for 2,3 and [arviz's addgroups](https://python.arviz.org/en/latest/getting_started/WorkingWithInferenceData.html#add-groups-to-inferencedata-objects) although its efficiency is questionable
- visualization algorithm for each popular data structure can verify + validate dynamic hypothesis 
- nested category
