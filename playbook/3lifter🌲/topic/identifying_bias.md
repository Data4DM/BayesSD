## Heuristic bias
From the beergame[^1] , following bias can be observerd:

### Adjustment bias, anchoring bias 
intercept
###  Representative bias 
###  Adjacent bias 
using the observed demand values


## Automation bias
- [[human-factors-in-healthcare-ai-white-paper.pdf]] defines as "Strategies need to be considered to guard against people relying uncritically on the AI, e.g., the use of explanation and training" which is failure to guard. This can be thought as diffusion movement (reinforcing) is much faster than regulating (balancing) i.e. soul much ahead of body.

## Inductive bias
### Generator Approximation bias
### Approximator Optimization bias
### Discriminator Statistical bias


## Illusional bias
= compromise with optimal conditional on the payoff averaged over the subjective temporal and spatial prior

-   To avoid posthumous glory of worse than better dynamics and to enjoy priorhumous appreciation of better than worse
-   related toÂ [[how-clever-is-random]]as we are using the benefits of locality i.e. prior knowledge
