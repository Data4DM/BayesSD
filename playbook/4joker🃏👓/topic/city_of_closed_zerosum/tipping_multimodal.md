Q1. Does mode of behavior (in phase space) correspond to mode in parameter space?

Q2. How to find the map between the two modes (in phase and parameter space), to be precise boundaries?

 > 2. Could you elaborate how discontinuity in optimal organization points to viability of good jobs in low cost service (blue lines from your abstract above)? Might this discontinuity disappear once the identification problem is resolved?

The performance landscape (i.e. expected profits as a function of different managerial choices) is bimodal in this setting, with two local peaks, one closer to a cost minimization strategy, and the other closer to the good jobs strategy. The estimated parameters for strength of various effets informs whether one peak, or the other, is profit-maximizing. The discontinuity arises because a small change in one parameter changes the dominant peak and thus shifts the optimal policy. The discontinuity may disappear depending on the estimated parameters: e.g. if in the empirically reasonable ranges one peak always remains dominant.

-   This would have connection with activation energy; lowering this energy would precipitate the reaction speed, while not changing the equilibrium (which is one of the topic for chemistry Nobel prize).
    
-   Ross is interested in finding the most energy-efficient way of intervention.
    

## Jeorun's Sustainable Transition

Jeorun's poster shows the two attractors of the aging chain dynamics. This is theoretical research that emphasize lock in but different stories can be told with empirical approach of this research that one of the two attractor is does not focusing on estimation could tell different story.

Two benefits of empirical study for attractors are detailed in [Teaching Goal > 2 879-Spring Validate Data - Draws - Demand](https://publish.obsidian.md/tolzul/%F0%9F%8C%80+MoonVolve/%F0%9F%8C%92+Crescent/auto(SBC)/Teaching+Goal#2%20879-Spring%20Validate%20Data%20-%20Draws%20-%20Demand) which is summarized as keep modelers away from borders by providing a more global view of the decision geometnry and removing attractors.

The degree of aggregation for stock y matters in y′=f(t,y,θ). Learning the procedure for plots and aggregation degree would be the next step.

More is discussed in section "Robustness and Boundary Conditions for a Bimodal Landscape" from [Rahmandad20](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2019.1347) or in [def(JobStrategy)](https://publish.obsidian.md/tolzul/MoonVolve%F0%9F%8C%80/3HalfMoon%F0%9F%8C%93/Job+strategy+%F0%9F%90%91/def(JobStrategy)).

## David's evidence of the importance of `ass_param` value

![Pasted image 20220919191416.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/54631a3e916ab8a92447441579fc1927/ref/Pasted%20image%2020220919191416.png)

From [Keith22](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/orsc.2022.1579) paper, dynamic shifts with different value of `ass_param` γ for the above, λ for the below

-   time horizon of decision making γ as 1/(1 − β ) to 0 for short to long-term.
-   performance emphasis λ indicate that funders place more emphasis on the performance outcomes of the ﬁrms they are funding
